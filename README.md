# **Embedded Artificial Intelligence - Lab Work**  

This repository contains the lab work performed for the **Embedded Artificial Intelligence** course, which explores the application of AI techniques in embedded systems. Through these labs, we worked on integrating machine learning models with real-world hardware and developing AI-based interfaces for constrained environments.  

## **Lab Experiments**  

### **Laboratory-1: Voice Controlling LEDs with Edge Impulse**  
- **Objective**: Create a voice-controlled system to toggle LEDs using machine learning models.  
- **Tools/Techniques**: Edge Impulse Studio, Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, STM32), and voice feature extraction.  
- **Outcome**: Successfully implemented a voice recognition model for real-time LED control based on specific voice commands.  

### **Laboratory-2: Indoor Scene Classification with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers**  
- **Objective**: Implement a lightweight neural network to classify indoor scenes (e.g., kitchen, office, bedroom).  
- **Tools/Techniques**: TensorFlow Lite, image feature extraction, and hardware deployment.  
- **Outcome**: Achieved accurate scene classification with efficient resource utilization on microcontrollers.  

### **Laboratory-3: Building a Gesture-Based Interface for YouTube Playback**  
- **Objective**: Develop a gesture-controlled interface for basic YouTube playback functions (play, pause, volume control).  
- **Tools/Techniques**: Accelerometers, gyroscopes, gesture classification, and real-time processing.  
- **Outcome**: Built a working prototype for gesture-based YouTube controls with high responsiveness.  

### **Laboratory-4: Neural Networks (NNs) Algorithm for Chips**  
- **Objective**: Design and implement a hardware-level neural network for decision-making tasks on chips.  
- **Tools/Techniques**: Verilog, hardware simulation, and NN weight optimization for efficient execution.  
- **Outcome**: Successfully implemented an NN algorithm tailored for hardware with real-time predictions.
